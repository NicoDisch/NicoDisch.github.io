Assuming you know the basics about vector spaces and matrices, which are basically mappings from vector spaces,
this will be a reminder to the eigenvalue equation and where it comes from.
Later we will explore the connection to the principal component analysis.



## Motivation


Let us first consider the following eigenvalue equation, afterwards we will motivate it

$ a^2 $
